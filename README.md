# Shooter
Simple shooter game coded in Lua using LOVE2D

## Description
This game was created for my programming language design course. The idea was to learn a new programming language and understand all of its features and then create a project with it. Due to the fact that Lua is heavily used in game design, including games such as World of Warcraft, I created my own simple 2D shooter. It is nothing fancy, but it is possible to win. Are you up for the challenge?
